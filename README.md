Assignment for the Frontend engineer position


This is an assignment i made for Workable.
I tried to use vanilla Javascript, as FAQ suggested instead of using a javascript library like React.
As it is my first time in the last 5 years that I use vanilla javascript without any framework/library, my code might not be perfect.

Thank you for your time and I am looking forward to meet you and move on in the hiring process.
